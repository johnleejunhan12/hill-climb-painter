# Hill Climb Painter

A Python desktop application that transforms images into paintings

![Image](/readme_stuff/hill_climb_painter.gif "Hill Climb Painter")

## Overview

Hill Climb Painter is an image reconstruction algorithm that transforms images and short animations into painted representations by sequentially placing textured brush strokes. A greedy hill-climbing algorithm is used to iteratively optimize each stroke’s position, rotation, and scale, minimizing the visual difference between the target image and the canvas.

Each brush stroke is assessed for its visual impact before being applied to the canvas, ensuring that only those contributing meaningful detail are added. As more strokes are layered, coarse and abstract forms are gradually refined into a structured and balanced composition, blending realistic detail with the textured aesthetics of impressionism.

## Installation and setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnleejunhan12/hill-climb-painter.git
cd hill-climb-painter
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```






## Usage
### Step 1: Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```
### Step 2: Select target and textures
Choose a target image to paint (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and choose textures (PNG) to be applied to the painting. 

Note: PNG is required for textures as it has an alpha channel to represent transparent pixels. Textures must be white in color, you can test the color of the texture by clicking on regions of the image.

### Step 4: View the painting process
If you checked the display painting progress, a pygame window will show the real time painting progress. You can also close the display to prematurely stop the painting process.

### Creative constraints


### 1) Different textures
The textures used are not limited to just brushstrokes. We can use various shapes such as circles, triangles and squares as the texture. We can also use unusual textures such as lines to produce a chaotic and scribbly abstract rendition of the original image.

### 2) Disable scaling of texture
By setting an initial texture size and restricting it, we can achieve painting styles like pointillism, where small textures are applied in patterns to form an image.



### 3) Vector fields

Vector fields `(f(x,y), g(x,y))` allow us to control texture directionality by constraining brush strokes to align with the field's flow. To demonstrate this, we create a radial sink pattern using the vector field `(-x, -y)`, which causes textures to converge toward a central point. By positioning this convergence point at the cat's nose `(267, 279)`, all brush strokes naturally flow inward, creating a focal point that draws the viewer's attention.

### 2) Prevent resizing of textures

### 3) 



## How it works
To generate a painted approximation of a target image using textures, we begin by initializing a blank canvas with the average RGB color of the target image. In this example, we will use 11 different paintstrokes as textures. 
![Image](/readme_stuff/how_work_1.png "Target, texture and canvas")
<br><br>
Initially, a random paint stroke is selected. It is assigned a random scale, position, and rotation. As seen in the image below, its color is computed by taking the average of the RGB values within the corresponding region of the target.
![Image](/readme_stuff/how_work_2_v2.png "Target and canvas")
<br><br>
Next, we need to determine whether the placement of a paint stroke is "good" or "bad".
To achieve this, we define a quantitative scoring system that satisfies the following criteria:


#### **Reward good placements that**:
- **Add more detail** to empty or blurry regions of the canvas, bringing it closer to the target image by filling in underdeveloped areas.
- **Use a suitable color** that closely resembles the corresponding region in the target image. This ensures the paint stroke blends naturally into the canvas.  
  > *Note:* Since the stroke's color is calculated using the average RGB values of the region it would cover, the most suitable colors occur when the target region has low color variance. The painted result will look more cohesive if strokes are placed in areas of consistent color rather than highly varied regions.
- **Maximize coverage** by filling in large areas of empty or blurry canvas without overwriting existing details.



#### Penalize bad placements that:
- **Make the canvas worse** by reducing its similarity to the target image. Such strokes are destructive and lead to a sloppier final result.
- **Overwrite already detailed or accurate areas**, which can undo valuable work already done in previous strokes.
- **Contribute little to no meaningful detail**. For example, placing tiny strokes in nearly empty areas. In such cases, using larger strokes would be more effective and should be encouraged.


### Scoring heuristic:
**1) Finding the error between the target image and canvas**

Pixel errors are calculated using root sum of squared difference between RGB values of the target and canvas.
![Image](/readme_stuff/how_work_3.png "Target, texture and canvas")
<br><br>

**2) Finding the error between the target image and canvas with paint stroke**

We calculate pixel errors again using the same formula but with the texture drawn onto the canvas
![Image](/readme_stuff/how_work_4.png "Target, texture and canvas")
<br><br>

**3) Obtain the difference between errors**

The final score is calculated by taking the difference in errors before and after the texture was added. As seen in the color map plot, textures that are well placed receive a higher score as they reduce the total pixel error between the canvas and target image.
![Image](/readme_stuff/good_score.png "Target, texture and canvas")
<br><br>
#### **Penalizing sub-optimal placements**
If the texture was placed in a suboptimal configuration, it will be penalized as shown in the red (negative) regions of the scoring color plot.
![Image](/readme_stuff/bad_placement.png "Target, texture and canvas")
![Image](/readme_stuff/bad_score.png "Target, texture and canvas")

***

### Greedy Hill Climbing

After an initial score is obtained, the texture undergoes random perturbations to its position, rotation, and scale. After each adjustment, the score is recalculated. If the new configuration yields a higher score, it is accepted; otherwise, the previous configuration is retained. 

![Image](/readme_stuff/scoring_texture_progress.gif "Target, texture and canvas")


This iterative process continues until an iteration limit is reached or terminates after a specified number of failed iterations without further improvement. 

***

### Painting the image
By repeatedly applying the same optimization technique across several hundred strokes, we gradually build up the image, layer by layer, until a coherent painting emerges. The GIF below illustrates the overall painting process where each stroke's position, scale, and rotation are optimized using greedy hill climbing before being committed to the canvas.

## 📷 Image Display Troubleshooting

If `![Image](readme_stuff/rainy_original.jpg)` is not displaying:

- **Check the file path:**  
  The path must be relative to the README location.  
  Example: If README is in the root and image is in `readme_stuff/`, use `readme_stuff/rainy_original.jpg`.

- **Verify the file exists:**  
  Make sure `rainy_original.jpg` is present in the `readme_stuff/` folder.

- **Check file extension and case:**  
  File extensions are case-sensitive on some systems.  
  Ensure the file is named exactly `rainy_original.jpg`.

- **GitHub cache:**  
  Sometimes GitHub caches images. Try refreshing or clearing your browser cache.

- **Corrupt image:**  
  Make sure the image file is not corrupted and can be opened locally.

- **Permissions:**  
  The image file should be committed and pushed to the repository.
